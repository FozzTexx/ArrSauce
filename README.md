## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy `config.h.template` to `config.h`
3. Edit `config.h` with your settings (e.g., WiFi credentials)
4. Open `RSOS-sensor.ino` in the Arduino IDE
5. Upload and run!

> Note: `config.h` is listed in `.gitignore`, so it wonâ€™t be committed to Git by default.

This code is placed in the public domain (or CC0 licensed, at your option).
